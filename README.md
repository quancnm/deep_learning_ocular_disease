# deep_learning_ocular_disease
Ocular disease classification


## Project Overview

The project that focuses on utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image processing techniques for the diagnosis of common retinal diseases. This project aims to provide an automated and accurate solution for early detection and diagnosis, leveraging the power of deep learning and medical image analysis.

## Problem Statement

This project addresses the challenge of early detection and diagnosis of retinal diseases, including conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma. By analyzing retinal images, the project seeks to identify patterns, anomalies, and disease indicators that might be imperceptible to the naked eye.
